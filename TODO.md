# DashBlocks TODO


## Event propagation up to dashboard level 

- [X] db-event: generated by all widgets and propagated up to dashboard
- [X] augment db-event with widget id on widget level 
- [X] Events for chartjs
- [ ] Events for plotly 


##  Dashboards 

- [X] Overlay - dashboard on top of video, picture, etc - on a boarder & bottom [DEMO](https://dashblocks.io/demo/#/overlayimage)
- [X] Dynamically generated dashboard based on data. I.e. multiple pie charts [DEMO](https://dashblocks.io/demo/#/dynamicsalesdashboard)

##  Test Data

- [X] Datasets, aggregation lib - use in sample dashboards
- [X] Time-series sample dataset - i.e. sales over time

[https://github.com/finos/perspective](https://github.com/finos/perspective) is used, together with [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) dataset
Perspective enables dynamically aggregating Arrow data

## Style, Themes and Colors

## Chart Types / Components

### D3

https://dashblocks.io/demo/#/dynamicsankey
https://dashblocks.io/demo/#/salessunburst

### Chart.js
- [x] Showcase dashboard

### Plotly 
- [ ] Showcase dashboard
- [ ] Consider: use more customized bundle ( specific modules ) instead of all-in-one. 
      plotly.js-dist is too big to include in bundle ( ~6M )   
       

### Dygraphs
- [X] Showcase dashboard
https://dashblocks.io/demo/#/dygraphsdynamic

### Dashblocks
- [X] Number 
- [X] Percent
- [ ] Multiple values - rows with sparklines
- [X] [Showcase dashboard](https://dashblocks.io/demo/#/)



### Other
- [X] Table - goodtable. Used in [dashblock-template separately](https://slanatech.github.io/dashblocks-template/#/vgt)  
- [X] Markup
- [ ] Markdown 
- [ ] Showcase dashboard


## Options templates

Create class to manage standard props/options templates for various chart types. 
So instead of specifying all props in dashboard definition always, just refer to 
template name (like DbDygraphs-AreaLine)

Consider making template parameterized, i.e. pass axis name (see plotly props)
